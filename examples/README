Running examples
==============

Most of the testing for this library has been done using mono and
xsp. To try out either the server or the consumer using xsp just
change to the example directory and type xsp. That should be it to
start the server.


Consumer
-------

To try out the consumer, just visit the host and port listed by xsp in
your web browser. Then type in an openid url to test out. 

Server
-----

Let's say the server example is running at localhost on port
8080. You'll need to use a consumer on your local network to test it
out (or bind the server to a public address). Then you'll type
http://localhost:8080/user/user1 into the consumer. The user name is
"user1" and the password is "test". To change these or add more users,
take a look at web.config in the server example directory.  

The server example currently doesn't remember sites you have approved
before, so checkid_immediate mode will always return a setup url.
